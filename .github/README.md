# Frodo Library 2.x - @rockcarver/frodo-lib

ForgeROck DO library, frodo-lib, a hybrid (ESM and CJS) library to manage ForgeRock Identity Cloud tenants, ForgeOps deployments, and classic deployments.

Frodo-lib powers [frodo-cli](https://github.com/rockcarver/frodo-cli), the command line tool to manage ForgeRock deployments.

## New In 2.x

2.x introduces breaking changes to support multiple instances of the library to run concurrently and connect to multiple different ForgeRock Identity Platform instances at the same time. [1.x](https://github.com/rockcarver/frodo-lib/tree/1.x) operates using a global singleton, making it impossible to connect to more than one platform instance at a time.

## Features

Frodo allows an administrator to easily connect to and manage any number of Identity Cloud tenants, ForgeOps deployment instances, or classic deployment instances from the command line. The following tasks are currently supported:

- Manage journeys/trees.

  Export, import and pruning of journeys. Frodo handles referenced scripts and email templates.

- Manage applications.

  List, export, and import applications (OAuth2 clients).

- Manage connection profiles.

  Saving and reading credentials (for multiple ForgeRock deployments) from a configuration file.

- Manage email templates.

  List, export, and import email templates.

- Manage IDM configuration.

  Export of IDM configuration. Import is coming.

- Print versions and tokens.

  Obtain ForgeRock session token and admin access_tokens for a ForgeRock Identity Cloud or platform (ForgeOps) deployment

- View Identity Cloud logs.

  List available log sources and tail them.

- Manage realms.

  List realms and show realm details. Allow adding and removing of custom DNS names.

- Manage scripts.

  List, export, and import scripts.

- Manage Identity Cloud environment specific variables and secrets.

  List and view details of secrets and variables in Identity Cloud.

- Platform admin tasks.

  Common tasks administrators need to perform daily that are tedious and repetitive. Advanced tasks, which used to be involved and potentially dangerous if performed manually, now made easy and safe.

  - Create an oauth2 client with admin privileges.
  - Get an access token using client credentials grant type.
  - List oauth2 clients with admin privileges.
  - Grant an oauth2 client admin privileges.
  - Revoke admin privileges from an oauth2 client.
  - List oauth2 clients with custom privileges.
  - List all subjects of static user mappings that are not oauth2 clients.
  - Remove a subject's static user mapping.
  - Add AutoId static user mapping to enable dashboards and other AutoId-based functionality.
  - Hide generic extension attributes.
  - Show generic extension attributes.
  - Repair org model (beta).

## Limitations

`frodo` can't export passwords (including API secrets, etc), so these need to be manually added back to imported configuration or alternatively, edit the export file to add the missing fields before importing.

## Installing

### Developer Mode

For those who want to contribute or are just curious about the build process.

- Make sure you have Node.js v16 or newer (v18 or v19 preferred) and npm.
- Clone this repo
  ```console
  git clone https://github.com/rockcarver/frodo-lib.git
  ```
- Install dependencies via NPM
  ```console
  cd frodo-lib
  npm ci
  ```

### NPM package

If you are a node developer and want to use frodo-lib as a library for your own applications, you can install the npm package:

- To install the latest version as a dependency for you own application:
  ```console
  npm i --save @rockcarver/frodo-lib
  ```
- To install the latest pre-release:
  ```console
  npm i @rockcarver/frodo-lib@next
  ```

## Using the library

Import the library members:
```javascript
import {
  // default instance
  frodo,
  // default state
  state,
  // factory function to create new instances
  FrodoLib,
  // factory helper function to create new instances ready to login with a service account
  createInstanceWithAdminAccount,
  // factory helper function to create new instances ready to login with an admin user account
  createInstanceWithServiceAccount,
} from '@rockcarver/frodo-lib';
```

create a new instance using factory helper function and login as admin user:
```javascript
async function newFactoryHelperAdminLogin() {
  const myFrodo1 = createInstanceWithAdminAccount(host1, user1, pass1);

  // destructure default instance for easier use of library functions
  const { getTokens } = myFrodo1.login;
  const { getInfo } = myFrodo1.info;

  // login and obtain tokens
  if (await getTokens()) {
    // obtain and print information about the instance you are connected to
    const info = await getInfo();
    console.log(`newFactoryHelperAdminLogin: Logged in to: ${info.host}`);
    console.log(`newFactoryHelperAdminLogin: Logged in as: ${info.authenticatedSubject}`);
    console.log(`newFactoryHelperAdminLogin: Using bearer token: \n${info.bearerToken}`);
  } else {
    console.log('error getting tokens');
  }
}
newFactoryHelperAdminLogin();
```

Create a new instance using factory function and login as admin user
```javascript
async function newFactoryAdminLogin() {
  const myFrodo2 = FrodoLib({
    host: host2,
    username: user2,
    password: pass2,
  });

  // destructure default instance for easier use of library functions
  const { getTokens } = myFrodo2.login;
  const { getInfo } = myFrodo2.info;

  // login and obtain tokens
  if (await getTokens()) {
    // obtain and print information about the instance you are connected to
    const info = await getInfo();
    console.log(`newFactoryAdminLogin: Logged in to: ${info.host}`);
    console.log(`newFactoryAdminLogin: Logged in as: ${info.authenticatedSubject}`);
    console.log(`newFactoryAdminLogin: Using bearer token: \n${info.bearerToken}`);
  } else {
    console.log('error getting tokens');
  }
}
newFactoryAdminLogin();
```
Use default instance and state:
```javascript
// destructure default instance for easier use of library functions
const { getTokens } = frodo.login;
const { getInfo } = frodo.info;

async function defaultAdminLogin() {
  // this has to be the base URL of your AM service, not just the host hame
  state.setHost(host0);
  // username of an admin user
  state.setUsername(user0);
  // password of the admin user
  state.setPassword(pass0);

  // login and obtain tokens
  if (await getTokens()) {
    // obtain and print information about the instance you are connected to
    const info = await getInfo();
    console.log(`defaultAdminLogin: Logged in to: ${info.host}`);
    console.log(`defaultAdminLogin: Logged in as: ${info.authenticatedSubject}`);
    console.log(`defaultAdminLogin: Using bearer token: \n${info.bearerToken}`);
  } else {
    console.log('error getting tokens');
  }
}
defaultAdminLogin();
```
