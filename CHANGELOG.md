## [Unreleased]

### Added

- New methods on State to allow setting global retry config as an [IAxiosRetryConfig](https://github.com/softonic/axios-retry/blob/4019333df603bf1bb27dae9311a96dd8edbe102b/src/index.ts#L10) object. Default is to have no retry config to maintain current behaviour.

### Fixed

- rockcarver/frodo-cli#477: Frodo Library now properly includes the transformation script for both `Social Provider Handler Node` and `Legacy Social Provider Handler Node`.
- rockcarver/frodo-cli#482: Frodo Library now properly honors the NO_PROXY environment variable in addition to HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY.

## [3.0.4-0] - 2025-03-31

## [3.0.3] - 2025-03-11

### Fixed

- rockcarver/frodo-cli#479: Fixes issues introduced by a recent PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud release (16747.0 on 27 Feb 2025) which prevented Frodo from correctly determining the deployment type of `cloud` and led to failures when adding connection profiles and creating service accounts.

## [3.0.2] - 2025-03-10

### Fixed

- rockcarver/frodo-cli#479: Fixes issues introduced by a recent PingOne Advanced Identity Cloud release (16747.0 on 27 Feb 2025) which prevented Frodo from correctly determining the deployment type of `cloud` and led to failures in the `frodo conn save` and `frodo conn add` commands when Frodo was attempting to create service accounts with scopes that are not available in an environment.
- Updated dependencies with vulnerabilities

## [3.0.1] - 2025-01-23

### Changed

- Support for new export options for full config exports. By default, the full exports will now only export "importable" config, i.e. the non-read only config, unless otherwise specified by the read only flag. However, just as it was before, all realms and global config will be exported by default unless otherwise specified by the new flags for realm only and global only.
- Removes duplicate IdP config exported as part of the SocialIdentityProviders service in the full config export since they are already exported separately. The service is still exported, but the nextDescendents field is deleted before returning the full export.

### Added

- New functions to read and import individual config schemas. For example, read or import just the user_role schema from the managed objects entity.

### Fixed

- Improved IdP imports where not including the redirectAfterFormPostURI attribute in the import would cause it to throw an HTTP 500 error.
- Updated dependencies with vulnerabilities

### Added

- Add governance API factory under `frodo.factory`:

  - `generateGovernanceApi`: Generates a Governance Axios API instance

### Changed

Fixes and improvements to imports and exports:

- Updated comments and type information to be more accurate and fix typos
- Fixed TrustedJWTIssuer exports/imports (since these will be included as part of the full config export/import in the future PR)
- Fixed service imports to work for federation services
- **_BREAKING_**: Updated exports for agents and esv secrets/variables to have a singular instead of plural type (i.e. `agents` => `agent`, `secrets` => `secret`, `variables` => `variable`). The reason for this is to make them more consistent with the rest of the exports which are also singular, and also because secrets plural will be used for exporting AM secret config in the future.
- **_BREAKING_**: For full exports, duplicate config is now deleted from the IDM exports since themes, email templates, and mappings are all handled separately.
- Fixed full imports to only import if the full import config contains the items being imported rather than erroring out.
- Fixed full imports to return the config items that were imported
- Fixed email template imports/exports. For exports, there was a bug with the api where not all email templates were being exported using “emailTemplate” as the type, but it was fixed by using “emailTemplat” as the type instead (not sure why this works, but it’s the best solution I could find to fix the problem).
- Moved functionality for handling env substitution and entity filters from CLI to lib for IDM exports/imports.
- Fixed a few bugs with importing/exporting journeys. The main issue that was found was that if you were importing a journey containing nodes that are not supported by the current deployment (e.g. IDM journey nodes from cloud being imported into a classic deployment of AM), the journey would still be imported. This would cause an error to be thrown on export of the journey preventing it as well as other journeys from being exported on full export. The fix here was to just prevent the import of the journey if this happens by erroring out to prevent those errors from happening on export.
- Fixed a few bugs with script imports to allow each of the 3 types of imports to work (i.e. if scripts are a single unencoded string, if scripts are a single encoded string, and if scripts are a decoded array).

## [2.2.1-0] - 2024-10-31

## [2.2.0] - 2024-10-10

### Added

- Expose API factory to developers using Frodo Library to configure AIC, ForgeOps, and PingAM deployments.

  Under `frodo.factory` developers now have access to:

  - `generateAmApi`: Generates an AM Axios API instance
  - `generateOauth2Api`: Generates an OAuth2 Axios API instance
  - `generateIdmApi`: Generates an IDM Axios API instance
  - `generateLogKeysApi`: Generates a LogKeys API Axios instance
  - `generateLogApi`: Generates a Log API Axios instance
  - `generateEnvApi`: Generates an Axios instance for the Identity Cloud Environment API
  - `generateReleaseApi`: Generates a release (Github or Npm) Axios API instance

### Fixed

- rockcarver/frodo-cli#445: Fixed an issue introduced with an update to Advanced Identity Cloud which renamed scopes for an upcoming feature and broke Frodo Library in a number of places.

## [2.1.2-0] - 2024-08-26

### Added

- Improve support for custom platform deployments (non-forgeops or customized forgeops)

  - rockcarver/frodo-cli#429: Added state functions to support custom oauth2 clients for IDM API calls:

    - `state.setAdminClientId(clientId: string): void`
    - `state.getAdminClientId(): string`
    - `state.setAdminRedirectUri(redirectUri: string): void`
    - `state.getAdminRedirectUri(): string`

  - rockcarver/frodo-cli#359: Added state functions to support custom IDM host URLs for all IDM API calls (e.g. platform deployments hosting AM and IDM on/in different DNS hosts/domains):

    - `state.setIdmHost(host: string): void`
    - `state.getIdmHost(): string`

## [2.1.1] - 2024-08-23

### Fixed

- Fixed the issue where the types were not specified correctly for consumers using ESM modules. When attempting to consume frodo with the tsconfig of `NodeNext` for `module` and `moduleResolution`, or `ESNext` for `module` and `Bundler` for `moduleResolution`, it was unable to determine types.

### Changed

#### Multi-Instantiability

2.x introduces breaking changes to support multiple instances of the library to run concurrently and connect to multiple different Ping Identity Platform instances at the same time. [1.x](https://github.com/rockcarver/frodo-lib/tree/1.x) operates using a global singleton, making it impossible to connect to more than one platform instance at a time.

#### New Library Structure

Removing the singleton pattern and introducing multi-instantiability forced a radical redesign of the core library functions while striving to maintain the basic usage pattern. The library is now exposing two main types describing its modules ([Frodo](https://rockcarver.github.io/frodo-lib/types/Reference.Frodo.html)) and state ([State](https://rockcarver.github.io/frodo-lib/types/Reference.State.html)). Each module in turn exports all its collection of functions as a type as well. Exposing the library structure as types enables auto-completion for both JS and TS developers with properly configured IDEs like Visual Studio Code or other and also serves as an abstraction layer between what the library exposes vs what and how it's implemented.

#### New `FrodoError` Class

All the errors thrown by the library are of the class `FrodoError`, introduced in 2.x. The new error class addresses the following challenges of earlier library versions:

- Allows applications using the library to determine if the error originated in the library or is an unexpected and unhandled error from deeper down the stack.

- Nesting of errors:

  When the library throws because it caught an error thrown deeper down the stack, it wraps the caught `Error` in a `FrodoError`.

- Nesting of arrays of errors

  The library supports many operation that require a number of actions to occur in a row or in parallel. Often these operations are REST API calls and any of those calls may fail for any reason. To preserve status of every operation, `FrodoError` can also wrap an array of errors, each of which may be another instance of `FrodoError` wrapping an individual or an array of errors.

- Provides a stack-like combined error message concatenating the messages of all wrapped errors and nested errors.

- Includes standardized fields to surface network errors in case the `Error` on top of the stack is an `AxiosError`.

- The new `printError` function recognizes `FrodoError` and prints a uniformly formatted expression of the error including an interpretation of the fields for network stack errors.

#### New Modules

The following modules have been updated and/or added since [1.x](https://github.com/rockcarver/frodo-lib/tree/1.x):

#### Secure Token Caching

The 2.x version of the library uses a secure token cache, which is active by default. The cache makes it so that when the `frodo.login.getTokens()` method is called, available tokens are updated in `state` from cache and if none are available, they are obtained from the instance configured in `state`. The cache is tokenized and encrypted on disk, so it persists across library instantiations. You can disable the cache by either setting the `FRODO_NO_CACHE` environment variable or by calling `state.setUseTokenCache(false)` from your application.
You can change the default location of the cache file (`~/.frodo/TokenCache.json`) by either setting the `FRODO_TOKEN_CACHE_PATH` environment variable or by calling `state.setTokenCachePath('/path/to/cache.json')`.

#### Automatic Token Refresh

The 2.x version of the library automatically refreshes session and access tokens before they expire. Combined with the new token cache, the library will maintain a set of valid tokens in `state` at all times until it is shut down. If you do not want to automatically refresh tokens, set the `autoRefresh` parameter (2nd param) of your `frodo.login.getTokens()` call to `false`.

#### Node.js Versions

- Dropped support for Node.js 14 and 16.
- Kept supporting Node.js 18.
- Added support for Node.js 20 and 22.

### Considerations

#### Platform Passwords And Secrets

Platform passwords and secrets are configuration values that are stored encrypted as part of platform configuration. Examples are oauth2 client secrets or service account passwords.

Frodo generally doesn't export platform passwords and secrets. The platform supports configuration placeholders and environment secrets and variables allowing administrators to separate the functional configuration from sensitive secrets and variable configuration values. `frodo` assumes administrators take full advantage of these capabilities so that there is no need or expectation that exports include passwords and secrets. However, where the APIs support it, administrators can seed import data with raw secrets and `frodo` will import them.

#### Advanced Identity Cloud Environment Secrets And Variables (ESVs)

Frodo supports exporting and importing of ESV secret values. To leave stuartship of secret values with the cloud environment where they belong, frodo always encrypts values using either encryption keys from the source environment (default) or the target environment. Frodo never exports secrets in the clear.

### Added

- rockcarver/frodo-cli#217: Support for authentication settings through new `frodo.authn.settings` module.

## [2.0.0-47] - 2023-11-02

### Added

- \#53: Frodo Library now uses a file-based secure token cache to persist session and access tokens for re-use. The cached tokens are protected by the credential that was used to obtain them. Session tokens are encrypted using the hashed password as the master key, access tokens are encrypted using the hashed JWK private key as the master key. Therefore only users and processes with the correct credentials can access the tokens in the cache.

  - There is a new TokenCache module with accessible functions for frodo clients (like frodo-cli) to use.
  - The State module has been extended to host meta data like expiration time for sessions and tokens and a new boolean field indicating if the library should make use of the new token cache or not: `state.getUseTokenCache(): boolean` and `state.setUseTokenCache(useTokenCache: boolean): void`.
  - The new default behavior is to always use the new token cache.

- \#340: Frodo Library now autotomatically refreshes expired session and access tokens.

  - The new default behavior is to automatically refresh tokens. However, if an application prefers to handle that on its own, it can call the `frodo.login.getTokens()` functino with a new `autoRefresh: boolean` parameter.

### Fixed

- rockcarver/frodo-cli#316: Frodo Library now properly exports scripts referenced by the `Device Match` node if the `Use Custom Matching Script` option is selected.

## [0.18.0] - 2023-01-13

### Added

- \#68: Support final implementation of Identity Cloud service accounts. Service accounts are the future way for applications to authenticate to Identity Cloud environments without using a personal tenant admin account. Tenant admins can create any number of service accounts and assign sets of privileges to each account. Frodo Library can create service accounts with the required privileges or can use existing service accounts.

  To create a service account use the new ServiceAccount API:

  ```js
  import { createJwkRsa, createJwks, getJwkRsaPublic } from './JoseOps';
  import {
    createServiceAccount,
    isServiceAccountsFeatureAvailable,
  } from './ServiceAccountOps';

  // check if the tenant supports service accounts
  if (isServiceAccountsFeatureAvailable()) {
    const name = 'sa';
    const description = 'service account';
    const accountStatus = 'Active';
    const scopes = ['fr:am:*', 'fr:idm:*', 'fr:idc:esv:*'];
    // create a java web key (JWK) using RSA
    const jwk = await createJwkRsa();
    // extract only the public key as a JWK from the full JWK
    const publicJwk = await getJwkRsaPublic(jwk);
    // create a java wek key set (JWKS) from the public JWK
    const jwks = await createJwks(publicJwk);
    // create service account
    const payload = await ServiceAccount.createServiceAccount(
      name,
      description,
      accountStatus,
      scopes,
      jwks
    );
    // uuid of new service account if creation succeeded
    const saId = payload._id;
  }
  ```

  To use a service account set the following state variables:

  ```js
  import { state } from '@rockcarver/frodo-lib';

  // setting both, id and jwk, instruct the library to use the service account
  state.setServiceAccountId(saId);
  state.setServiceAccountJwk(jwk);
  ```

- Add support for additional environment variables:

- `FRODO_SA_ID`: Service account's uuid. If set, must also set `FRODO_SA_JWK`.

- `FRODO_SA_JWK`: Service account's java web key (jwk) as single-line string. Jwk must contain private key! If set, must also set `FRODO_SA_ID`.

- `FRODO_AUTHENTICATION_SERVICE=journey`: Specify a login journey for frodo to use.

- `FRODO_MOCK=1`: Enable mocking. If enabled, frodo-lib replays recorded API responses instead of connecting to a platform instance.

- `FRODO_POLLY_LOG_LEVEL=info`: Frodo mock engine log level (`trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `silent`). This is helpful for troubleshooting the mock capability, only.

  Environment variables added in 0.17.1:

  - `FRODO_HOST`
  - `FRODO_REALM`
  - `FRODO_USERNAME`
  - `FRODO_PASSWORD`
  - `FRODO_SA_ID`
  - `FRODO_SA_JWK`
  - `FRODO_LOG_KEY`
  - `FRODO_LOG_SECRET`
  - `FRODO_DEBUG`

- Add new `InfoOps` module (exported as `Info`) to obtain details about the connected platform instance.

- Add support to delete IDM config entities

- Add function to check RCS status

- Add mock mode for library to allow unit testing of clients using the library, like frodo-cli. This initial release contains minimal mock data. Enable mock mode using `FRODO_MOCK=1`.

- Updated list of contributors in package.json

- More automated tests

### Changed

- Ongoing refactoring of code base:
  - Migrate automated tests from ForgeRockApiMockEngine to Polly.js and snapshots.

### Fixed

    const jwk = await createJwkRsa();
    // extract only the public key as a JWK from the full JWK
    const publicJwk = await getJwkRsaPublic(jwk);
    // create a java wek key set (JWKS) from the public JWK
    const jwks = await createJwks(publicJwk);
    // create service account
    const payload = await ServiceAccount.createServiceAccount(
      name,
      description,
      accountStatus,
      scopes,
      jwks
    );
    // uuid of new service account if creation succeeded
    const saId = payload._id;
  }
  ```

  To use a service account set the following state variables:

  ```js
  import { state } from '@rockcarver/frodo-lib';

  // setting both, id and jwk, instruct the library to use the service account
  state.setServiceAccountId(saId);
  state.setServiceAccountJwk(jwk);
  ```

- \#154: Frodo-specific transaction id in all API requests: `frodo-<random uuid>`

- Support AM realm and global services.

  ```js
  import { Service } from '@rockcarver/frodo-lib';

  const {
    createServiceExportTemplate,
    deleteFullServices,
    deleteFullService,
    getListOfServices,
    getFullServices,
    exportServices,
    exportService,
    importServices,
    importService,
  } = Service;
  ```

- Support import IDM configuration.

  ```js
  import { Idm } from '@rockcarver/frodo-lib';

  const { putConfigEntity } = Idm;
  ```

- \#139: Support for Agents / Gateways.

  ```js
  import { Agent } from '@rockcarver/frodo-lib';

  const {
    AGENT_TYPE_IG,
    AGENT_TYPE_JAVA,
    AGENT_TYPE_WEB,
    createAgentExportTemplate,
    getAgents,
    getIdentityGatewayAgents,
    getJavaAgents,
    getWebAgents,
    exportAgents,
    exportIdentityGatewayAgents,
    exportJavaAgents,
    exportWebAgents,
    exportAgent,
    exportIdentityGatewayAgent,

    exportWebAgent,
    importAgents,
    importIdentityGatewayAgents,
    importJavaAgents,
    importWebAgents,
    importAgent,
    importIdentityGatewayAgent,
    importJavaAgent,
    importWebAgent,
  } = Agent;
  ```

- \#180: Allow all connection parameters to be supplied using environment variables for secure CI/CD:

  - `FRODO_HOST`
  - `FRODO_REALM`
  - `FRODO_USERNAME`
  - `FRODO_PASSWORD`
  - `FRODO_SA_ID`
  - `FRODO_SA_JWK`
  - `FRODO_LOG_KEY`
  - `FRODO_LOG_SECRET`
  - `FRODO_DEBUG`

- \#141: Add curlirizer support for troubleshooting. The library can output curl commands for every REST API call it makes. Clients can use this functionality by registering a curlirize handler and enabling the feature:

  ```js
  import { state } from '@rockcarver/frodo-lib';

  /**
   * Output a curlirize message
   * @param {string} message the message
   */
  export function curlirizeMessage(message) {
    if (!message) return;
    console.error(message['brightBlue']);
  }

  state.setCurlirizeHandler(curlirizeMessage);
  ```

- Added new `raw` Saml2 API functions that use the classic (pre 7.0.0) SAML REST APIs. This allows Frodo to export and import SAML entity providers from pre 7 platform instances.

  ```js
  import { Saml2 } from '@rockcarver/frodo-lib';

  const { getRawProviders, getRawProvider, putRawProvider } = Saml2;
  ```

- More automated tests

- \#107: Frodo now sets identityResource on import when the target is ID Cloud or ForgeOps but the import file was exported from a classic deployment
- Better journey import resiliency by handling `400 - invalid attribute` errors and retrying without the attributes. This is necessary to import journeys exported from a different version requiring different configuration options. Use the `--verbose` parameter to see when invalid attributes are being removed on import.

## [0.12.5-0] - 2022-09-19

## [0.12.4] - 2022-09-17

### Added

- Frodo now allows two new parameters when adding a connection profile:

  \--authentication-service [service] Name of the authentication service/tree to use.

  \--authentication-header-overrides [headers] Map of headers: {"host":"am.example.com:8081"}.

  These parameters are currently only supported in the `frodo conn add` command and the configuration elements will be automatically applied to commands issued using that connection profile.

      % frodo conn add https://platform.example.com:9443/am username password --authentication-service ldapService --authentication-header-overrides '{"host":"am.example.com:8081"}' -k
      ForgeOps deployment detected.
      Connected to ForgeRock Access Management 7.2.0 Build 64ef7ebc01ed3df1a1264d7b0400351bc101361f (2022-June-27 08:15)

      Advanced setting: Authentication Service: ldapService
      Advanced setting: Authentication Header Overrides:
      { host: 'am.example.com:8081' }
      %

  After the connection profile is created with the additional parameters, the environment can be accessed as usual. In this case it requires the `-k` parameter for every command, as the environment uses a self-signed certificate.

      % frodo journey list platform alpha -k
      ForgeOps deployment detected.

### Added

- \#205: Added `--no-deps` option to `journey export`/`import` commands. This allows users to omit all external dependencies from a journey export and/or import. One use case where this comes in handy is when using frodo as a CI/CD tool to extract and deploy individual configuration artifacts and it is desirable to not mingle multiple types of configuration in a single file but keep each type of configuration in its own file for version and change control.
- Added `--verbose` option to `journey export` command.
- \#341: Added initial smoke tests to validate basic functionality.

### Changed

- \#363: Frodo now performs dependency resolution and reports unresolved dependencies on single journey imports.

  - The sub-commands `export`, `exportAll`, and `exportAllRaw` have been collapsed into one: `export`
    - `idm export -A` (`--all-separate`) is now the way to export all idm configuration.
      - Options `-e` and `-E` select old `exportAll` functionality with variable replacement and filtering
      - Omitting options `-e` and `-E`, selects the old `exportAllRaw` functionality without variable replacement and without filtering
  - Renamed sample resource files for `idm export` command:
    - `<frodo home>/resources/sampleEntitiesFile.json`
